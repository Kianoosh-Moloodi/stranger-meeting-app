# Video Call Web App

This is a video call web application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io and WebRTC. With this app, users can initiate video calls with each other by using a private code. Once the connection is established, users can chat with each other using a peer-to-peer connection. The application also provides a feature to record video calls and save them on the user's device.
